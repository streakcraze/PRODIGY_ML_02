# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Algorithm

Customer segmentation is the process of grouping a company's customers using shared characteristics so that the company can cater to each group effectively and appropriately. Machine learning models can process customer data and discover patterns difficult to spot through intuition and manual examination of data. K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that uses an iterative process to divide an unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only to one group that has similar properties.

# Summarizing the k-means algorithm

<pre>
randomly choose k examples as initial centroids
while true:
  create k clusters by assigning each example to closest centroid
  create k new centroids by averaging examples in each cluster
  if centroids don't change:
    break
</pre>
